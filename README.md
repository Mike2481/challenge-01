# challenge-01

This marketing page needed an overhaul to align with the desired accessibility standards. Included in this overhaul, were the addition of alt attributes for page images as well as replacing all the generic HTML tags with semantic tags.

Both HTML and CSS files were given comments highlighting changes made as well as page outline.  The HTML file was reworked to ensure everything was in sequential order, and the CSS file was condensed to remove redundant code.

By completing this work, I was able to make an existing page more accessible.

While completing this project, I ran into trouble creating a header wherein the H1 and nav would show on the same line with the desired spacing.  Ultimately, I had to style a div within the nav tag.
